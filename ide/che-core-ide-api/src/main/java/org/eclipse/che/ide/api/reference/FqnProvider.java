 * fully qualified when it "is complete in the sense that it includes (a) all names in the
 * hierarchic sequence above the given element and (b) the name of the given element itself." Thus
 * fully qualified names explicitly refer to namespaces that would otherwise be implicit because of
 * the scope of the call.
