#
# Workspaces are the fundamental runtime for users when doing development. You can set
# parameters that limit how workspaces are created and the resources that are consumed.

#     The maximum amount of RAM that a user can allocate to a workspace when they
#     create a new workspace. The RAM slider is adjusted to this maximum value.
che.limits.workspace.env.ram=16gb

#     The length of time that a user is idle with their workspace when the system will
#     suspend the workspace and then stopping it. Idleness is the
#     length of time that the user has not interacted with the workspace, meaning that
#     one of our agents has not received interaction. Leaving a browser window open
#     counts toward idleness.

#####                             USERS' WORKSPACE LIMITS                          #####

#     The total amount of RAM that a single user is allowed to allocate to running
#     workspaces. A user can allocate this RAM to a single workspace or spread it
#     across multiple workspaces.
che.limits.user.workspaces.ram=-1

#     The maximum number of workspaces that a user is allowed to create. The user will
#     be presented with an error message if they try to create additional workspaces.
#     This applies to the total number of both running and stopped workspaces. 
che.limits.user.workspaces.count=-1

#     The maximum number of running workspaces that a single user is allowed to have.
#     If the user has reached this threshold and they try to start an additional
#     workspace, they will be prompted with an error message. The user will need to
#     stop a running workspace to activate another.

#####                             ORGANIZATIONS' WORKSPACE LIMITS                  #####

#     The total amount of RAM that a single organization (team) is allowed to allocate
#     to running workspaces. An organization owner can allocate this RAM however they
#     see fit across the team's workspaces.
che.limits.organization.workspaces.ram=-1

#     The maximum number of workspaces that a organization is allowed to own. The
#     organization will be presented an error message if they try to create
#     additional workspaces. This applies to the total number of both running
#     and stopped workspaces. 
che.limits.organization.workspaces.count=-1

#     The maximum number of running workspaces that a single organization is allowed.
#     If the organization has reached this threshold and they try to start an
#     additional workspace, they will be prompted with an error message. The
#     organization will need to stop a running workspace to activate another.
