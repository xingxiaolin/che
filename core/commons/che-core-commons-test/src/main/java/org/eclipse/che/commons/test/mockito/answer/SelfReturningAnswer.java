/**
 * Allows create mocks for builder-like classes easily
 *
 * <p>If builder-like classes needs to be mocked then:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>methods of that class returns the same object
 *   <li>not all methods can be called
 *   <li>methods can be called in different order
 * </ul>
 *
 * In that case it is hard to mock that class. With the help of this class it can be achieved as:
 *
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 *     HttpJsonRequest httpJsonRequest = mock(HttpJsonRequest.class, new SelfReturningAnswer());
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * In that case all methods of httpJsonRequest that returns HttpJsonRequest will return
 * httpJsonRequest;
