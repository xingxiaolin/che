#
# Parameters that affect the initial system operation.
#

# IP address, hostname, or DNS
#     The IP address or DNS name of where the Che endpoint will service your users.
#     If you are running this on a local system, we auto-detect this value as the IP
#     address of your Docker daemon. On many systems, especially those from cloud hosters
#     like DigitalOcean, you must explicitly set this to the external IP address or
#     DNS entry provided by the provider. This value can be overridden on the command
#     line with '-e CHE_HOST=<value>'.
#CHE_HOST=localhost

# Port
#     The port on the host Che will bind itself to. This value can be overridden on the 
#     command line with '-e CHE_PORT=<value>'.
#CHE_PORT=8080

# Proxies
#     Che's internal services such as Java & curl need system properties applied
#     so they can reach the Internet. Che uses the Internet to reach DockerHub
#     and to route workspace activity. Che is configured to inherit proxy
#     parameters from your Docker daemon settings. Those settings are applied
#     to these variables automatically during initialization, but you can override
#     them here.
#
#     Please be mindful of proxy URL formatting. Proxies are unforgiving if the URL is
#     not typed properly, including the protocol and a trailing slash '/'.
#CHE_HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_HTTPS_PROXY=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_NO_PROXY=<ip-or-domains-that-do-not-require-proxy-access>

# Proxies for Workspaces
#     The proxy values that will be set as environment variables within each user's.
#     workspace. Set these to allow users Internet access if they are behind a proxy.
#CHE_WORKSPACE_HTTP__PROXY=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_WORKSPACE_HTTPS__PROXY=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_WORKSPACE_NO__PROXY=<ip-or-domains-that-do-not-require-proxy-access>

# DNS resolving servers
#     Comma separate list of IP address that point to DNS resolving servers. In
#     some secure environments or those behind a proxy, custom DNS resolution
#     is required to resolve DNS names. You can set internal DNS servers or external
#     ones to this configuration. This applies DNS resolution to the Che server and
#     to the runtimes of the workspaces created from this Che server. This value
#     defaults to inheriting DNS resolver list from host running Che.
#CHE_DNS_RESOLVERS=<ip-of-dns-resolving-servers>

# JPDA
#     If using Che in development mode, activate this property to enable JPDA
#     mode within Che's internal Tomcat
#CHE_DEBUG_SUSPEND=false
#CHE_DEBUG_PORT=8000

# Che master logs
#
# Choose variant of Che master logs encoding and storing. Default is `plaintext`.
# Another supported value is `json` which makes Che master produce JSON encoded logs
# in system output of PID 1 process of container. Useful for storing logs in systems such as Logstash.
# CHE_LOGS_APPENDERS_IMPL=plaintext

#CHE_WORKSPACE_VOLUME=/path/on/host:/path/in/workspace:ro,Z;/path/to/host2:/path/in/workspace2:ro,Z;

# Privileged Mode
#     Set to `true` if you would like user workspaces to be started with Docker's
#     privileged mode. Please be careful when setting this property. This allows

#CHE_DOCKER_PRIVILEGED=false

# HostConfig SecurityOpt Parameters
#     This parameter allows to specify custom security options for the created docker container.

#
# Browser --> Che Server
#    1. Default is 'http://localhost:${SERVER_PORT}/api'.
#    2. Else use the value of CHE_API
#
# Che Server --> Docker Daemon Progression:
#    1. Use the value of CHE_INFRA_DOCKER_DAEMON__URL
#    2. Else, use the value of DOCKER_HOST system variable
#    3. Else, use Unix socket over unix:///var/run/docker.sock
#
# Che Server --> Workspace Connection:

#    - If CHE_DOCKER_IP is set use its value
#    - Else use the address of the workspace container within the docker network and exposed ports
#
# Browser --> Workspace Connection:
#    - If set use the value of CHE_DOCKER_IP_EXTERNAL
#    - Else, if Docker for Mac or Windows use localhost
#    - Else, if set use the value of CHE_DOCKER_IP
#    - Else use the address of the workspace container within the docker network and exposed ports
#
# Workspace Agent --> Che Server
#    1. Default is 'http://che-host:${SERVER_PORT}/api', where 'che-host' 
#       is IP of server.
#    2. Else, use value of CHE_INFRA_DOCKER_MASTER__API__ENDPOINT
#    3. Else, if 'docker0' interface is unreachable, then 'che-host' replaced with
#       172.17.42.1 or 192.168.99.1
#    4. Else, print connection exception

# Che Server API Endpoint
#     The location of the API end point where dashboard and IDE clients will look for
#     interacting with the Che server, which we also call the workspace master.
#CHE_API=http://${CHE_HOST}:${CHE_PORT}/api
# Che Server default websocket endpoint.
#     Provides basic communication endpoint where clients can get/push statuses/output.
#CHE_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT=ws://${CHE_HOST}:${CHE_PORT}/api/websocket

# Docker Daemon URL
#     How the Che server will discover the location of the Docker daemon. If this is
#     not set, then Che will use DOCKER_HOST or the default unix:///var/run/docker.sock.
#     It would be rare to need to set this as most clients set DOCKER_HOST or volume
#     mount a Docker socket when starting the Che CLI.
#CHE_INFRA_DOCKER_DAEMON__URL=NULL

# Docker Host
#     How Che will connect to the Docker host if CHE_INFRA_DOCKER_DAEMON__URL is not set. This
#     value can be provided on the command line as well. If this value is not set, then
#     Che will use the volume mount of unix:///var/run/docker.sock.
#DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375

# Docker IP Address
#     The IP address of the Docker daemon that is running on your host. The Che server
#     uses this IP address to establish a connection to your workspaces when they
#     first boot. This is different from how the Che server first establishes a
#     connection to the Docker daemon. After a Che server has instructed a Docker
#     Daemon to create a workspace, the Che server then discovers the location of the
#     workspace using the value of this IP address. We use auto-discovery to determine
#     this IP address. You can provide this value to override the default discovery
#     which searches Unix sockets and DOCKER_HOST. 
#CHE_DOCKER_IP=172.17.0.1

# External Docker IP Address
#     The external IP address used by browsers to connect to workspace containers that
#     are running on a Docker network. After Che has created a workspace runtime, those
#     Docker containers need to be reachable by remote browsers. Browsers will default
#     to using CHE_DOCKER_IP, then unix sockets, or DOCKER_HOST if this is not set. 
#     This will generally work if the browser and the workspace are on the same network.
#     However, if the browser and the workspaces are on different networks, then you
#     may need to set this value to the external IP address of your host or Docker to
#     make workspaces reachable.
#CHE_DOCKER_IP_EXTERNAL=NULL

# Usage of single-port routing.
# By enabling single-port, all browser traffic to Che or any workspace will be routed
# through the value that you have set to CHE_PORT`, or 8080 if not set. Setting this
# property will transform the launch sequence of Che to launch a Traefik reverse proxy.
# The reverse proxy will act as the traffic endpoint for all browser communications.
# When a new workspace is started or stopped, Che will update Traefik's configuration
# with rules for how browser traffic should be routed to Che or a workspace.
#
# With single-port, each service running in a workspace and exposing ports has its own hostname.
# Example : workspace agent will have a hostname like : ws-agent.workspace-id....domain.name
# By default the domain name will use nip.io which allow to provide wildcard DNS without any
# user configuration.
CHE_SINGLE_PORT=false

# Wildcard DNS host and port for the single port mode. Default is nip.io.
# Only http protocol is currently supported.
#CHE_SINGLEPORT_WILDCARD__DOMAIN_HOST=NULL
#CHE_SINGLEPORT_WILDCARD__DOMAIN_PORT=NULL

# IP-less wildcard dns in single mode. This needs a *.domain.tld DNS entry. (Use it instead of
# nip.io)
#CHE_SINGLEPORT_WILDCARD__DOMAIN_IPLESS=false

# Default rewriter for URLs in links.
# This variable is automatically overridden in single port mode.
#CHE_INFRA_DOCKER_URL__REWRITER=DEFAULT

# Time(in seconds) that limits the docker build process.
# The default value is 8 minutes, after which the build will be considered as failed.

# Docker Registry for Workspace Snapshots
#     Docker is the default machine implementation within Che. Workspaces are powered

# Private Docker Images
#     If pushing snap images to a registry requires authenticated access to the
#     registry. Or, if your stacks reference private images which require authenticated
#     access to a registry in order to pull, then you can configure 1..n registries 
#     with authentication access. We will perform a `docker login` with this

#     sets amount of units available per whole CPU.
#     Max value of quota could be period * number of CPU cores in a system.
#     Example:
#         These values allows usage of 100% of 2 cores on 2+ cores system.
#         Period declares that 100% is equal to 5000 units
#         and container is allowed to use 2x more than 1 core.
#         Although max consumption is explained in cores performance workload will be
#         split between several cores.

# CGroup Parent
#     CGroups allow admins to to configure limits on nodes in a system in a specific

#     without a slash for relative value. Docker will create this cgroup if it is missing.
#     Admin can configure limits on this cgroup on all nodes in a system specific way.
#     Example:
