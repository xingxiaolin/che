 * Contract for a step in the contribution workflow.

 * <p>Step should not depend on another steps as it is a workflow part but workflow is defined by
 * {@link ContributionWorkflow} implementations. Each step should end its execution with either
 * {@link WorkflowExecutor#done(Step, Context)} or {@link WorkflowExecutor#fail(Step, Context,
 * String)} method.
 *
 * <p>{@link WorkflowExecutor} fires {@link StepEvent} for each done/fail step if this step is not
 * {@link SyntheticStep}.
 *
 * <p>If step contains common logic for several steps then this logic should be either extracted to
 * the other step or used along with factory (e.g. {@link PushBranchStep}).
